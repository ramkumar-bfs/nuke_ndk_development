    //! not intended to be a photoreal renderer the way surfaces react to light is still
    //! important for proper surface simulation, especially with respect to the handling of
    //! opacity/presence for accurate compositing.
    //!
    //! Some surfaces are always solid (100% opaque,) like metal, and others can be partially
    //! transparent (ignoring vapor-deposited metals) like a plastic or glass. Some surfaces have
    //! fine geometric details or gaps and can vary their presence at a subpixel rate, usually
    //! by texture. Some surfaces are very transparent to light and produce refraction effects,
    //! like glass or water, but are otherwise 'solid'. Other surfaces can filter light without
    //! significant refraction, like a thin plastic film (a gel or transparency) or thin glass.
    //!
    //! All of these are considered 'optical traits' of the surface and affect how rays are handled
    //! for intersection. For example a surface declaring it supports 'thin transmission' means
    //! rays can pass through without refraction and only stop if the opacity or presence is 100%.
    //! A shadow path is an example of this where typically we don't want to compute costly
    //! refractions(caustics) through the surface but still want to know the attenuation of the
    //! light through the surface for accurately filtered or colored shadows.

    //! Note on presenceVaries() - can this surface change its presence weight per sample or is it
    //! constant (solid) across the entire surface? If it can vary that indicates this shader

    /*! Calculate the presence weight for the shading context. Called during ray
        intersection only when doesPresenceVary() is true for this surface.
        Default implementation returns 100% presence.

        If varying opacity is being used to create presence then it will be
        pre-calculated by the intersection code by calling surfaceOpacity() on this
        shader and the value passed in via the \a opacity arg, and this method then
        implements the threshold test. Note - do not call surfaceOpacity() from this
        method as you will be doing double work.

        Usually 1.0 (solid) should be returned from this call unless the surface
        shader knows what its presence weight is. Note that presence is explicitly
        different than transparency/opacity and communicates how physically solid the
        surface is, not how opaque the surface is to light transmission.
        For example a glass surface is solid and yet transparent to light, so a
        shader representing glass would set out.opacity() to 0.0 or some thin value,
        and yet return 1.0 for presence since the glass surface is physically solid.
        Note that a fog or similar participating-medium atmospheric effect is considered
        'physically solid' for the purposes of presence/coverage since the effect usually
        covers the entirety of the subpixel sample and thus is 'fully there', but is not
        optically opaque and thus would affect light transmission.

        Coverage/presence can be between 'not there'(0) and 'fully there'(1) typically
        when filtered texture values are used as the presence argument. For example a
        texture representing the pattern of a fine black mesh could have a uniform albedo
        color of 0,0,0, a uniform opacity of 1.0, and one channel of the texture used to
        modulate the returned sample's presence weight rather than sample's opacity.

        Why does this matter? When subsampled surfaces are merged (stacked) together the
        presence weight is used to determine if the sample should be composited (>0) or
        just ignored (0). Total pixel coverage is calculated by adding up all the
        composited subpixel presence weights.
