    //! A GraphScope is an immutable object that holds GsvSets. A Gsv is a Graph
    //! Scope Variable that is defined by a Node and set to a GraphScope during
    //! the Op tree generation.
    //! GSVs can be used in expressions, for example, a GSV named 'dir' used in
    //! a Read node file path like "/Volume/%dir" and can be resolved to
    //! different values depending on the GraphScope used in the context.
    //! A GraphScope can have a parent scope, which allows for the GraphScope to be
    //! extended and overriden.
    //! A GraphScope can be directly constructed via a GraphScopeRepository, or
    //! indirectly via an existing GraphScope that will call the GraphScopeRepository
    //! under the hood.
