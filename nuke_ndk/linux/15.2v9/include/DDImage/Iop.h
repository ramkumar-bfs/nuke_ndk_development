         This must set the contents of info_.  Usually this is done by
         calling validate() on some input and then assigning that to
         info_, and then possibly modifying that information. You should
         use the copy_info(), merge_info(), and init_merge_info() methods
         if possible to set the info, or maybe Iop::Info::clear(), and
         then modify the results as needed:
         \code
         copy_info();

         info_.turn_on(Mask_RGB);
         info_.merge(*(info_.format));
         \endcode

         An operator can also detect that it will not do anything to some
         channels and call set_out_channels(). If you set this to Mask_None
         then this will prevent _request(), _open() and engine() from being
         called. Besides being faster this often makes coding a plugin
         easier because you don't have to worry about the degenerate cases
         except in _validate():
         \code
         if (gain == 1) {
          set_out_channels(Mask_None);
         } else {
          set_out_channels(Mask_All);
         }
         \endcode

         If something is wrong you can call error(). This will throw an
         exception and _validate() will not be called again until invalidate()
         is done.

         \a for_real is true if Nuke is going to ask for image data from the
         operator. Otherwise it is only doing this to get the frame range,
         format or other information from the info_. If it is false you should
         try very hard to avoid anything expensive such as opening files and
         you must avoid producing errors that don't happen on every frame since
         that would prevent dissolves operators from fading out inputs during
         the time they produce errors.

         For many operators the action is the same whether \a for_real is
         true or false.  If you don't use any inputs and cannot avoid
         opening a file and want to avoid opening it twice, recursively
         call yourself like this. This is what Read operators do if they
         don't have the format and channels set yet:
         \code if (!for_real) {validate(true); return;} \endcode

         The default version merges the info from all the inputs and then
         turns on the channels in out_channels() if it is not Mask_All.

         This should call request() on any inputs that are going to be used.
         Usually it will modify the arguments slightly:
         \code input0().request(x-1, y-1, r+1, t+1, channels, count); \endcode

         If you are going to randomly access the input, you should request
         it's entire bounding box:
         \code input0().request(channels, count); \endcode

         \a count indicates approximately how many times engine() will
         be called for each value of y. You should pass it unchanged or multiply
         it by a value greater or equal to 1 if your engine() asks for more
         than one input line. This is used to set up caching by knowing how
         many times a line will be needed. \a count may be zero to indicate
         that a previous request is being expanded with more area or more
         channels.

         The default implementation requests the \e same area from each
         input. You will need to change this if your operator does random
         access, possibly to call the request() method that takes no area
         and thus accesses the format. It uses in_channels() to figure out

          usually recursively call request() on each input.

          All calls to request() are unioned together and intersected with
          the info() produced by validate().  All subsequent calls to get
          pixels (by get(), Tile and Interest constructors, or by calling
          at()) are clamped to this area. Missing channels return zero,
          positions outside the box return the pixel from the nearest edge
          of the box.

          Although usually you want the request box to cover everything you
          will ask for, an operator may limit the size to avoid causing huge
          amounts of data to be cached. For instance some transforms request
          extremely large areas but reduce them to smaller than a single
          pixel, limiting the sampled area to only the non-scaled part of the
          input image and replicating the edge pixels will not degrade the
          transformed image significantly and will use far less memory.

          This is used to set up the automatic caching. The region is used
          to determine how much data to store in the cache. The \a count
          argument is used to indicate that engine() will be called more
          than once for a given y value. A count of N and calling request() N
          times have identical behavior. A count of zero indicates that a
          previous request() call is being expanded in area (zero acts like
          1 if this is the first call). Caches are placed by analyizing the
          slowness() and resulting counts of all the Iops (the current
          algorithim is simple and just turns on the cache on all operators
          with a count greater than one).

          Calling Op::forget_request() will make the next request() reset
          the accumulated area.  You may also want to call cache_new_pass()
