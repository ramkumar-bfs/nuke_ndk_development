        \brief Base class of all the things that can be created by
        Nuke nodes.

        Nuke will create these things, hook their inputs to other ones,
        manage animation and store animated values into these by calling
        the knobs() function, and delete these when the node is destroyed.

        Nuke will also invisibly manage multiple copies hidden inside a
        single node, where each copy is at a different time. This allows
        a later operator to ask for several time samples and merge them
        together in order to get motion blur.  */

          will open data files or calculate lookup tables. It can call
          error() to abort all the processing, if for instance your data
          files are missing.

          All _open() calls are done inside a single locked mutex, so there are
          no multithreading issues even if several instances of a plugin, or
          several different plugins, try to update a shared data structure.

         For back-compatibility, Nuke calls this after 5.0 seconds of idle
         time. Future versions may not call this at all unless
         callCloseAfter() is done, so you should add callCloseAfter(5.0)
         to your plugins to retain compatibility.

         Typically _close() will close files, destroy cached data, and call
         close() on internal operators. It should not destroy any data that
         it might have returned pointers to (i.e. metadata, cached images,
         etc) unless valid() is false. To make sure internal caches are
         destroyed, it should call both invalidate() and close() on any
         internal Op instances.

         Despite the name, this is not the opposite of open(). open() is
         undone by invalidate(). This may be called multiple times after
         open() and may be called before open() is ever called.

          this. This works by calling find_description() and if that
          succeeds it calles the constructor() function in the description.

          An Op can use this to create any other operator, even one in a
          plugin, as part of itself.  You should do this inside _validate()
          and not inside the constructor so that any errors can be reported
          correctly.  If there is a problem finding a plugin or loading it
          this will call error() with an appropriate error message and
          return zero.  You should quit in this case, perhaps setting some
          flags so that further calls to your object will not crash.

          You will need to cast the result if you want to use it. For
          instance if it is an Iop you should use dynamic_cast<Iop*> on
          it. If this does not work (returning a zero) you should call
          error() with an appropriate message and give up.

          The name passed in is not the necessarily the name that that the node
          has in the UI: instead it is the name returned by the Class() function
          in C++ and Python for the node. (For example, the regular Merge node's
          internal name is "Merge2", and "Merge" refers to the original Merge
          node, left in for compatibility.

          If you have a header file or other description of the object you
          can store settings into it using methods from the header file.  If
          you do not have the header file you can still use the
          field() method to put values into it.

          functions that you should use instead of calling \a callback
          directly.  This file also documents all the existing built-in
          types.

          When knobs are being created \a callback takes an enumeration value that
          defines the type of knob being created, and the name, label, and
          arbitrary extra data to pass to the constructor, and a pointer
          to data that may (depending on the knob type) be used to get a

          Use of only the enumerated types avoids the need to link with
          Nuke, thus allowing your image operator to be used with other

          \a callback, you can pass 0 for all the arguments except the pointer,

         Return an op tree that \e could be connected to input \a n. This allows
         you to peek at your input ops before validate() is called, such
         as in knobs() or in the constructor. Or you can use this to
         peek at an input after uses_input() returns zero or split_input()
         returns zero or negative.

         \a n is the user-visible input number. If you implement
         split_input() this may be different than input(n), but it is
         the same as input(n,0).

         \a type determines what exactly is in the returned op.
         - Op::OUTPUT_OP returns an Op that you can call Class() on but
         not much else. Knob values have not been stored in it and no
         inputs are hooked up.
         - Op::ANY_CONTEXT will return an op created for this version of the tree
         but it may return it set to a different OutputContext. This lets
         you call almost anything but you cannot depend on any animated
         values being correct.
         - Op::INPUT_OP is like ANY_CONTEXT but skips disabled nodes so it
         returns the actual op that will be used to create data. Used by code
         that wants to peek at the output data, such as the format or frame
         range, but does not require the exact correct frame number or view.
         - Op::EXECUTABLE forces the OutputContext to be a certain value.
         Don't use this as I have not decided what this certain value is yet
         (may be uiContext(), outputContext(), or inputContext()...)
         - Op::EXECUTABLE_INPUT both forces the OutputContext and skips
         disabled nodes, and also inserts hidden ops used to generate
         Postage stamps and texture maps. This is as close as possible to
         the actual Op that will be connected to this input.

         If the input is not connected, OUTPUT_OP will return NULL, since
         this is commonly used to check if an input is connected. Note that
         if default_input(n) returns NULL, you cannot distinguish a disconnected
         input from an input connected to a Switch or other non-op node that
         is itself disconnected.

         All other values for \a type return default_input(n) if the input
         is not connected.

         Except for \a type of OUTPUT_OP, this is slow, and if the context it
         uses is wrong, it will cause extra instances of the entire Op tree
         to be generated, which can be very wasteful depending on the Op.

      /*! \class DD::Image::Op::Description

          A subclass of Op that wants to appear on Nuke's menu or be
          created by a Nuke script command must create one or more static
          instances of this structure.  The constructor adds itself to a
          list which Nuke scans to find all the possible operators.

          The code that goes into a plugin to create the entry looks like this:

          \code
         static const char* const MYCLASS = "MyOp";
         class MyOp : public Op {
         static const Description description;
         public:
         const char* Class() const {return MYCLASS;}
         ...
         };

         static Op* build(Node* node) {return new MyOp(node);}
         const Op::Description MyOp::description(MYCLASS, build);
          \endcode

          It is required that the string inside the description and returned
          by Op::Class() be the exact same pointer. This is checked by Nuke.
          It is also required that this string is the same as base name of
          the plugin file, or the name of a .tcl file that says "load foo"
          where foo is the name of this plugin file. Nuke only stores the
          name in the saved script, so this is necessary for it to find the
          plugin again.
